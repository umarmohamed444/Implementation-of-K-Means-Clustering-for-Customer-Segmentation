# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.Import the required packages.
2.Import the dataset to work on.
3.From sklearn module import kmeans.
4.Define number of clusters to be made.
5.Assign the cluster values.
6.Plot the cluster using matplotlib.pyplot
7.End the program. 

## Program:
```
